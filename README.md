#Competitive Coding

This repository consists of some of the commonly used Data structures and Algorithms used in Competitive Programming. 

The "C" folder contains full implementations of the code with some random tests as well

The "C++" folder contains templates only and comments explaining the complexity in terms of space and time. These can be used directly in your code when you require them. Just read the commments before so that you know where to use them.

Some of the programs/implementations have been written by me, others have been modified/copied from some sources or internet. In most of the cases the source has been mentioned too. 

If you feel something is not explained properly, you may report it. You are free to contribute to it as well.
